Games
=====

A collection of Python games I've built. 

### Random Roman Numeral Generator
Test your skills at converting Roman Numerals to Base 10 or vice versa. To brush up on your Roman Numeral reading skills, visit http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5_2o8MITH4 for a nice history lesson. 

### Caesar Cipher
Say you receive an encrypted message. You know that it's been encrypted using a Caesar Cipher, but you don't know the decryption key. This script will help you decrypt the message. 
The idea was inspired by Al Sweigart's 'Hacking Secret Ciphers With Python'. You will need the pyperclip module to use this script, found below.

### Hangman

The one most of us remember learning as children. Uses an extensive wordlist (58,000+) found below, which makes this an excellent challenge.

### Towers of Hanoi

Currently working on this one. I'm using Pygame, which will make this so much cooler!

### Labyrinth
Labyrinth is a text based interactive logic puzzle. It was inspired by ‘Sarah’s Certain Death Riddle’, a scene from the Jim Henson film Labyrinth starring David Bowie. This was my first personal creative project with Python.
