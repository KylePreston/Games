Games

A collection of Python games I've built. 

### Labyrinth
Labyrinth is a text based interactive logic puzzle. It was inspired by ‘Sarah’s Certain Death Riddle’, a scene from the Jim Henson film Labyrinth starring David Bowie. This was my first personal creative project with Python.

### Hangman

The one most of us remember learning as children. Uses an extensive wordlist found below, which makes this an excellent challenge.
